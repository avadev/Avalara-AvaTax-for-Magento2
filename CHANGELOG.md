* Add code to create new database tables dedicated to storing AvaTax data
* Add code to migrate existing data from AvaTax columns on sales_invoice and sales_creditmemo tables to new tables
* Refactor code to store AvaTax data in new tables instead of attaching to entities
* Previous versions of this extension added two fields to the native Magento invoice and credit memo tables. When this extension
  changed the values of these two fields, it would save the invoice/credit memo. This caused multiple issues (see [#24](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/24), [#29](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/29), [#36](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/36), [#40](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/40), and [#47](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/47)). 
  Rather than continuing to try and fix the underlying Magento issues that were triggered by saving these objects, we have moved
  the fields to separate database tables (avatax_sales_creditmemo and avatax_sales_invoice). This release includes that refactor and 
  fixes issue [#47](https://github.com/classyllama/ClassyLlama_AvaTax/issues/47).
